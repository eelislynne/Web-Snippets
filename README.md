## Teleprompter - Scrolling text
We were just about to start filming a prompter video at Bayer, and got annoyed, because the prompter software we used didn't support line breaks.
I wrote this in about 10-20 minutes, so it's quite horrible, but it works. Uses jQuery.

### Features
* Line break support
* Single file
* Speed & font size controls
* In prompter controls (start/stop, reset, scroll up & down)
