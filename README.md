This repo will contain all the small web projects/snippets that I make.

## Teleprompter - Scrolling text
We were just about to start filming a prompter video at Bayer, and got annoyed, because the prompter software we used didn't support line breaks.
I wrote this in about 10-20 minutes, so it's quite horrible, but it works. Uses jQuery.

### Features
* Line break support
* Single file
* Speed & font size controls
* In prompter controls (start/stop, reset, scroll up & down)


## Radio buttons for anything
My friend was working on a project and wanted to have "radio buttons" that didn't look like shit. He told me that he didn't find any open source alternative, so I decided to make one. This just uses some jQuery to do radio button like functionality. The radio group is done with a parent div. The current selection value is written to an input.

### Features
* Radio buttons for any object (div, p, img, you name it)
* Lightweight
* jQuery (you decide if that's a positive or a negative)
* Support for form inputs to be handled in your backend


## Web Crawler
A very basic web crawler to go through specific links on a site and search the pages of those links for specific texts.
The crawler is super basic and will need to be adjusted for different scenarios, just thought to put it here as a concept. Execute this in console.

### Features
* Find specific links
* Search filter pages
* Console log output
